ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Andrew. 

Having previously worked as a [media production professional](https://andrewbantly.me/), my passion for software engineering was ignited during my time at [Reliable Robotics](https://reliable.co/). Collaborating with a talented and diverse team of engineers, I was exposed to the complexities and challenges they faced. Witnessing their problem-solving prowess as they dissected intricate issues layer by layer, I became deeply inspired to transition my career in pursuit of similar challenges.

I recently graduated from an immersive software bootcamp at General Assembly, and the experience has surpassed my expectations. I am immensely proud of the projects I have undertaken and encourage you to check them out for yourself.

[Pick'em](https://pickem.herokuapp.com/) | [Technical documentation](https://github.com/andrewbantly/pickem#pickem)

**Description:** I individually deployed a full-stack, data-rich Node application using modern JavaScript coding, testing, and debugging techniques that incorporates four relational database management system models, user authentication and authorization, RESTful APIs, and object-relational mapping (ORM)

[World Class Wines](https://andrewbantly.github.io/world-class-wines) | [Technical documentation](https://github.com/andrewbantly/world-class-wines#world-class-wines)

**Description:** Engineered an immersive data visualization application that merges D3.js (Data-Driven Documents), React, and Python

[National Parks Explorer](https://nps-explorer.netlify.app/) | [Technical documentation](https://github.com/andrewbantly/npsexplorer-client)

**Description:** Worked in a small team to develop an interactive, user-experience driven MERN stack application with RESTful JSON APIs, integrated third-party APIs, CRUD functionalities, and managed Git merges and resolved merge conflicts

[Escape From Alcatraz](https://andrewbantly.github.io/Escape-From-Alcatraz/) | [Technical documentation](https://github.com/andrewbantly/Escape-From-Alcatraz#escape-from-alcatraz)

**Description:** Individually deployed an online, user-friendly game that incorporates document object model (DOM) manipulation, behavioral logic, and object detection using JavaScript

Currently I'm focused on learning new technologies, up leveling my skills, and building applications that solve problems for clients. I'm particularly excited to delve into emerging technologies such as Go, Flask, and D3.js as they offer immense potential for innovation and pushing the boundaries of software development.
