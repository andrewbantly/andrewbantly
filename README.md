ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @andrewbantly. 

As an ambitious software engineer, I am fueled by the boundless possibilities that lie ahead. With six years of invaluable experience in media production, I possess a distinctive skill set that allows me to approach problem-solving from a fresh and innovative perspective. My unwavering determination drives me to deliver cutting-edge solutions that have a significant impact on the entire software development life cycle.

Presently, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities as a full-stack software engineer, leveraging my diverse background and expertise.

Having previously worked as a media production professional, my passion for software engineering was ignited during my time at Reliable Robotics. Collaborating with a talented and diverse team of engineers, I was exposed to the complexities and challenges they faced. Witnessing their problem-solving prowess as they dissected intricate issues layer by layer, I became deeply inspired to transition my career in pursuit of similar challenges.

Currently, I am enrolled in an immersive software bootcamp at General Assembly, and the experience has surpassed my expectations. I am immensely proud of the projects I have undertaken and encourage you to check them out for yourself.
