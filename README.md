## Bio
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m [Andrew](https://www.andrewbantly.dev/).

Having previously worked as a [media production professional](https://andrewbantly.me/), I developed an appreciation for software engineering during my time at [Reliable Robotics](https://reliable.co/). Collaborating with a talented and diverse team of engineers, I was exposed to the complexities and challenges they faced. Witnessing their problem-solving prowess as they dissected intricate issues layer by layer, I became deeply inspired to pivot my career in pursuit of similar challenges.

In May 2023, I completed an immersive software engineering bootcamp with General Assembly. Over the course of 12 weeks, I dedicated more than 600 hours to learning various technologies, including Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, React, Next, Python, Django, and more.

Throughout my professional journey, I've had the privilege of adapting my skills to diverse industries. I've contributed to Reliable Robotics, a startup focused on automating aircraft operations; the San Francisco Giants, a professional baseball organization; and the CK-12 Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to providing free, high-quality education.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy skiing down challenging slopes, exploring scenic roadways on my bike, and leisurely walks with my dog, Murphy.
