## Bio
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m [Andrew](https://www.andrewbantly.dev/).

Having previously worked as a [media production professional](https://andrewbantly.me/), my passion for software engineering was ignited during my time at [Reliable Robotics](https://reliable.co/). Collaborating with a talented and diverse team of engineers, I was exposed to the complexities and challenges they faced. Witnessing their problem-solving prowess as they dissected intricate issues layer by layer, I became deeply inspired to pivot my career in pursuit of similar challenges.

I completed a 12-week, 600+ hour bootcamp focused on Git, Github, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python, React, Django, and more. 

I am currently working on an internal tool for a Phoenix-based real estate investment company using Python, Django, NoSQL database integreation, TypeSript, Angular, and SCSS.
