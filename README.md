ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andrewbantly. 

As a determined software engineer, I am driven by the endless opportunities that lie ahead. I bring six years of valuable media production experience and possess a unique blend of skills that enables me to approach problem-solving with a fresh perspective. I am ready and eager to deliver innovative solutions and make a meaningful impact on the software development life cycle.

I'm currently looking for full-time roles as a full-stack software engineer. 

Formerly a [media production professional](https://andrewbantly.me/), I was motivated to pivot my career towards software engineering after working with engineers of diverse backgrounds while at [Reliable Robotics](https://reliable.co/). There, my job was to humanize the team and the work. While I accomplished these goals, I too was inspired by the problems they solved and how they broke large and challenging problems down layer by layer. 

I'm currently completing an immersive software bootcamp at General Assembly. It continues to exceed expectations and I am really proud of the projects I'm building. Check them out!

I'm currently learning React, MongoDB and Python. Upon graduation, I plan to practice the languages I've learned but also explore technologies I haven't. Specifically, Rust, Go, Phoenix, and Flask.
