ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Andrew. 

As an ambitious software engineer, I am fueled by the boundless possibilities that lie ahead. With six years of invaluable experience in media production, I possess a distinctive skill set that allows me to approach problem-solving from a fresh and innovative perspective. My unwavering determination drives me to deliver cutting-edge solutions that have a significant impact on the entire software development life cycle.

Presently, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities as a full-stack software engineer, leveraging my diverse background and expertise.

Having previously worked as a [media production professional](https://andrewbantly.me/), my passion for software engineering was ignited during my time at [Reliable Robotics](https://reliable.co/). Collaborating with a talented and diverse team of engineers, I was exposed to the complexities and challenges they faced. Witnessing their problem-solving prowess as they dissected intricate issues layer by layer, I became deeply inspired to transition my career in pursuit of similar challenges.

Currently, I am enrolled in an immersive software bootcamp at General Assembly, and the experience has surpassed my expectations. I am immensely proud of the projects I have undertaken and encourage you to check them out for yourself.

I'm currently honing my skills in React, MongoDB, and Python. Upon completing my studies, my intention is to apply and further develop these languages while also venturing into unexplored technological realms. I'm particularly excited to delve into emerging technologies such as Rust, Go, Phoenix, and Flask, as they offer immense potential for innovation and pushing the boundaries of software development.
